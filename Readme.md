# ThreeJs Projects

This GitHub repository contains two projects related to computer graphics. Each project has its own set of instructions and objectives. Below you will find a brief description of each project.

## Project 1: Transformer

The Transformer project is focused on creating an interactive scene. The scene includes fixed cameras, geometric primitive instantiation, simple animations, and collision detection. The main objectives of this project are to understand and implement the architecture of an interactive graphics application, explore geometric modeling concepts through primitive instantiation, work with virtual cameras, apply basic animation techniques, and implement simple collision detection techniques.


## Project 2: Alentejo Region and UFO

This second project involves creating an interactive scene with various elements such as meshes, materials, lights, textures, and a stereoscopic camera.


Please refer to the individual project sections for more detailed instructions on how to interact with each scene.
